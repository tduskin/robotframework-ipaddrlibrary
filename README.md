robotframework-ipaddrlibrary
=============

A Robot Framework library for querying address and hostnames, and performing IP 
subnet math

Description
-----------

IPAddrLibrary is a library for Robot Framework which provides keywords for
manipulating IP addresses and hostnames.  This library will provide basic
host-to-ip and ip-to-host conversion, as well as IP address subnet math.

This library depends on python-iplib (http://www.mimante.net/soft/iplib)

Documentation for available keywords is in the doc directory (generated by libdoc)

Installation
------------

1.  Install python-iplib (pip install iplib)
2.  Get the source
3.  Copy src/IPAddrLibrary to your Robot Framework library directory
4.  Add "IPAddrLibrary" to your test suite's Settings table, e.g::
   
        *** Settings ***
        | Library | ./IPAddrLibrary/ |
   
You can now start using the keywords in your user keywords and test cases.

Issues
------
No doubt there are bugs and missing functionality in this library.  If you encounter any 
problems or have a feature request (i.e. new keywords you'd like to have), please open
an issue on the project's github issue tracker:
